### To-do

- [x] Wireframe
- [ ] Create 16x16 grid of square `div`s
    - [ ] Create it dynamically using  JS
    - [ ] put it all in a `.container`
    - [ ] make it appear as grid vs. One on each line
    - [ ] No `margin`, `padding`
- [ ] Setup `:hover` effect
    - [ ] CSS class or JS ?
- [ ] Make button for choosing grid size
    - [ ] Replace the old grid
    - [ ] All in one container -fixed space-
    - [ ] Max = 100
    - [ ] JS fun when button clicked
    - [ ] `prompt`
- [ ] debugging
    - [ ] 64x64 works?
- [ ] Each pass through change it to a completely random RGB value. Then each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
